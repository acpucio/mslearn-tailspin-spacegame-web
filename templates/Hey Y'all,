Hey Y'all,

Just a reminder submissions for your three - one minute video recordings are needed by this coming Sunday, June 7.  You'll be telling stories or reflecting on your lives before and during Covid-19, as well as your hopes afterwards.

This piece by Joanna Macy goes into this idea more deeply (https://www.activehope.info/three-stories.html)

Here's a link with some decent tips on filming yourself with a smartphone (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9nOQdgSHOw).  

Also, it'll be good for people assigned readings to send their selections so we can time and discuss them.  These will be read live over zoom, so no need record yourselves for those.  The reading assignments were recorded in the trello (https://trello.com/b/LkJvoLgh/uucl-s-2020-youth-service).

Finally, thanks everyone who's putting together the music pieces.  I can't wait to hear it.  :)

If there's anything I left out on this message, please feel free to CC everyone in reply with a hint.

Thanks and Be Well,
Albert
